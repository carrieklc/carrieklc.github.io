## Hi, I'm Carrie.

I am a student in the Master of Data Science program at the University of British Columbia and ~~will make it out alive~~ graduate in July 2019.

This is a compilation of my thoughts on data science-related (and not so related) topics by day, and a personal blog of my journey as a Data Scientist by night.
