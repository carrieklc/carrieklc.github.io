# Master's in Data Science — Online or In-Person?
---
With the recent surge in interest surrounding data science, you might have noticed more and more master’s degree programs focused specifically on this field being offered. Since the nature of data science is very much digital and we live in an age where remote alternatives are increasingly common, there are also many options to complete such a program online. So, if you’ve decided to pursue a master’s or advanced degree in this field, a likely question you might grapple with is: Which format should you opt for &mdash; **online or in-person**?

As a current master’s student studying data science myself, this was definitely something I thought a lot about before deciding which format was the right fit for me. Since I was employed full-time before I made the transition back to student life, there were some major pros to continue working while simultaneously pursuing further education. However, this kind of balancing act is not without its cons as well. For those contemplating the same question, I share in this post the main factors and questions I considered when making this decision.

## Financials

Obviously, this is one of the most important considerations for the majority of people. Online programs are typically more cost-effective in terms of tuition expenses...although it is true that this is not always the case. Especially if you’re interested in enrolling in an online program at a more well-known college in the United States, even the online option can cost over $60,000 USD [(case in point)](https://datascience.berkeley.edu/admissions/tuition-and-financial-aid/)!

I have to admit this was shocking to me, considering the cost of my in-person tuition is less than half that amount. Of course, if we want to compare apples to apples, we’d have to dig into details, like the length of the program, number of courses taught, content covered and so on. But if we were make a generalization, online programs usually cost less than the in-person format, with some exceptions.

One side bonus of the online format is that you’ll save on travel costs getting to and from school &mdash; pick your poison: whether that it be gas for driving, transit pass for commuting, etc.

A major advantage for online is that it offers more flexibility in scheduling, which can also make it easier or even possible for you to keep a job while studying. The income from working would offer some financial breathing room, helping to offset living expenses and costs of the program.

A former coworker of mine exercised this option by completing an online master’s in data science in two years while working full-time. Sure, the jury is still out on whether he shortened his life by the same amount of time from the stress of juggling two full-time gigs...and it may sound slightly masochistic, but it’s definitely possible. Many people do this in order to reap the rewards of completing a degree on the cushion of a full-time salary, but buyer beware! If you’re the type who prefers focusing your time and attention on one major life goal at a time, then this probably doesn’t sound appealing to you. Know yourself.

On the other end, many in-person programs are offered only as full-time studies. The major financial-related con here is that financials become an even more important issue since you’d have to foot the bill for tuition plus living expenses for the duration of the program. Personally, I only considered institutions in my general metropolitan area, but if you are relocating for the program, you’d also have to factor in moving costs and living expenses of the particular city you are moving to.

Be sure to check whether your employer has an education reimbursement program or policy. If so, research the terms and conditions of the policy. Who is eligible? What kind of program can be reimbursed? Are there any stipulations upon graduation? These are all good questions to ask and getting answers could require you to do some digging into the fine print. Some policies only reimburse part-time programs or another specific format; others require you work a certain number of hours for the company while enrolled, which may or may not be possible depending on your school workload and life priorities.

## Learning Style
Know what your preferred learning style is. For example, do you learn best studying at your own pace by yourself without the distraction of others, or do you prefer to learn in a classroom amongst other students with whom to bounce off questions and discuss new ideas? An online format is likely more appealing if you like to work independently and are intrinsically motivated to keep up with not only assignments, but also self-studying.

I had some past experience taking online courses back in my undergrad days and also as part of certification programs for work. Although I made these work, I always found something lacking in this format of education personally. I knew I thrived better having “external cues,” like going to class and interacting with other students, to help me feel immersed in an environment for learning. Since I also felt less stressed and more at ease when I’m in sync with my preferred learning style, there was also a positive ripple effect in my personal life outside of academics.

From these experiences, I knew learning style was something that would be difficult for me to compromise on, without some major mindset shifts. So try to reflect on the kind of learning style or environment where you’ve felt most comfortable and motivated.

## Support
Regardless of your preferred learning style, no can’t argue that having a good support network makes it much easier to get through tough times, whether that be during a week of exams or hitting deadlines for a group project. Personally, I didn’t truly appreciate how valuable the support of my fellow classmates would be at the beginning of my program. Fast-forward six months, and I’ve now experienced time and time again how the support of my peers can work wonders to help pull me through times when deadlines and stress start to mount.

This isn’t to say that only an in-person format can provide that &mdash; I think online platforms like YouTube and Twitter have already proven that this certainly isn’t the case. With remote discussion channels and online learning tools, many online programs can be effective in creating a sense of community as well. Even my in-person program supplements discussions outside of lectures with Slack, where much of the answers to our questions on class material are crowdsourced, provided by instructors, support staff and fellow students alike.

There is, however, something especially appealing about sitting down with a group of classmates face-to-face and talking through a particularly difficult assignment or project. Misunderstandings surface quicker and get resolved more readily, helping to increase productivity. With an in-person format, it can also be easier to feel part of a network or community simply by physically being in class with like-minded peers pursuing the same goals as you. Remote learning may require more effort on your part to consistently check in online and ensure you’re keeping updated with posts or messages, calls and virtual meetings.

## Summary
One obvious caveat is that we all have different needs and life situations, so this is by no means an exhaustive list of things you'd want to consider. I know when I'm in the middle of trying to make a big decision, I find it useful to soak up as much information, content and perspectives as I can. So hopefully, this might be helpful to some of you going through a similar dilemma.

**No matter which format you choose, commit yourself to the opportunity and don’t forget to enjoy the ride. Good luck!**
