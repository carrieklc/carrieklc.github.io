Ten months ago, I quit my job and embarked on an adventure. That adventure saw me don a backpack once again. Before you think I set off to the backcountry of Europe to recreate my own "eat pray love" moments and partake in deep soul-searching, I'll interject and say some soul-searching did happen but I was firmly planted in Vancouver (on the UBC campus, in fact) and I proudly donned a backpack...as a full-time student.

I started the [Master of Data Science program at UBC](https://masterdatascience.ubc.ca/) in September of last year. This adventure was no fanciful whim in the park, however, as it'd been something I had been planning for almost a year. Financially, professionally and even emotionally, it was a big decision for me to go back to school after working full-time for six years. It required preparation and self-reflection, but I knew it would be the right step for me. Fastforward ten months later, I've completed the program and live to tell the tale with no regrets.

Near the end of my studies, I did an interview with the program to talk about my experience in MDS. The questions in that interview got me thinking about main takeaways and tips I have that could be helpful to prospective students considering or about to start the program. In this blog post, I share some of my answers to questions in those areas. Hopefully, this might be useful for some of you out there!

**What have been the top benefits of the program?**

>1) Learning a range of highly relevant material that has been carefully designed and curated into one package, taught by professors who are experts in their field.
>
>2) Being in an immersive environment where you live and breathe data science everyday, surrounded by peers who are just as motivated as you are to learn.
>
>3) The capstone project at the end of the program offers a great opportunity to apply what was learned in the classroom to real business problems faced by companies today.

**Your Top 3 tips on succeeding in the program?**

>1)  The program is fast-paced and requires that you commit to staying on top of assignments. If you were a procrastinator in school, don't fall back to these procrastinating ways! Your future self will thank you.
>
>2) Talk to your peers and instructors if you don't understand something or get stuck. Don't suffer silently! Take advantage of the resources available, including the career-related events organized specifically by the program.
>
>3) When things get hectic, this often goes out the window but don't forget to take care of yourself - eat well, exercise and get some sleep. It's hard to understand what a neural network is when your own neural network is operating on coffee and no sleep.
